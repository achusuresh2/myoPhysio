# myoPhysio
iOS app that helps you rehab for carpal tunnel using the Myo armband

#What it does:
Using data from the Myo armband, myoPhysio monitors the position of the patients hand and guide them through various exercises. The android application counts down and ensures the user holds each position 5 seconds as sensed by the armband before moving onto the next exercise. The app also sends notifications to remind the user to exercise everyday. myoPhysio essentially gives patients the benefits of having a personal physiotherapist, since it only requires the armband and a smartphone.
